# OmegaT Manual Development Sandbox Project

## Purpose of the Project

OmegaT uses DocBook as the foundational framework for its manual authoring tools. Historically, OmegaT has been based on DocBook version 4.5.1.

However, DocBook 5 was released more than 15 years ago, and this project serves as a proof-of-concept (PoC) and workspace for handling the preliminary and experimental tasks necessary to migrate to DocBook 5.

Given the extensive amount of manual content and translations currently in use, migrating all content at once is extremely challenging.

This project is designed to assist in the migration process by providing a separate environment to handle these tasks in a more focused and incremental manner.
